# The Pivotal Alumni Codex

A place for the links to the things we wish we'd taken with us. Hosted at GitHub at https://alumni-codex.github.io/ and as a redirect from https://pivotal.fun/codex. 

Given that the [Pivotal Alumni Slack][slk] is free, and free Slacks have only 90-day retention, we use this site to bookmark web stuff that we find helpful _after_ Pivotal.

- The `main` branch of this repo the source code for this site
