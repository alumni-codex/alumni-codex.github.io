# Contributing to the Pivotal Alumni Codex

## What Content Belongs Here?

Anything about Pivotal, especially practices and tools, that we don't have a public version posted somewhere. 

If you're looking for it, chances are someone else wants it, too. Let's archive as much as possible/practical here.

To keep this site up, we won't post anything that is intelluctual property of a company. This means no slide decks, documents, or images of those, that have any corporate logo or copyright. We will remove any content that does. 

## About This Site

This is a static site, generated from a set of Markdown files in the [Alumni Codex repository][repo] using MakeDocs, and hosed as a GitHub Pages site at [GitHub](https://github.com).

If you want to add anything or make any changes, you need a [GitHub account][join]. There are more detailed instructions and guidelines in the [Contributing Guide][guide].

If this is daunting, reach out to Davis (@DWF on the Slack) and he'll help you out. 

## "Ownership"

In order to work with GitHub Pages (and thus stay free), there is a standalone GitHub Account. For purposes of complying with GitHub policies and limitations, Davis "owns" this account. It uses a gmail "+" address and has saved username/password, 2FA, and recovery codes. If at any point we need to transfer ownership of this project, Davis will hand this data off to a new owner.
