# Contributing to the Pivotal Alumni Codex

## What Content Belongs Here?

Anything about Pivotal, especially practices and tools, that we don't have a public version posted somewhere. 

If you're looking for it, chances are someone else wants it, too. Let's archive as much as possible/practical here.

To keep this site up, we won't post anything that is intelluctual property of a company. This means no slide decks, documents, or images of those, that have any corporate logo or copyright. We will remove any content that does. 

## About This Site

This is a static site, generated from a set of Markdown files in the [Alumni Codex repository][repo] at [GitHub](https://github.com).

If you want to add anything or make any changes, you need a [GitHub account][join]. There are more detailed instructions and guidelines in the [Contributing Guide][guide].

If this is daunting, reach out to Davis (@DWF on the Slack) and he'll help you out.
