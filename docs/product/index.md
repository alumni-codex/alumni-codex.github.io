## Hypothesis Tracker

The hypothesis tracker was a tool used by Labs Pivots to capture and easily synthesize data across a large number of interviews. TRUE, FALSE and N/A is entered into every cell aligning with a hypothesis and a participant so that researchers (usually designers and product managers) could see what they learned from a research project at-a-glance.
