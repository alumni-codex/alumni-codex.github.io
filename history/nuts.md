SF,
The Lebanese people (my people) have a rich history of making awesome contributions to humanity: civilization, the alphabet, sea travel, delicious food, etc... Much to the benefit of the world, we are a humble people -- always eager and willing to share our many accomplishments. In fact, by allowing many attacking forces to occupy us (egyptians, persians, assyrians, greeks, romans, arabs, seljuks, mamluks, crusaders, ottomans and, of course, the french) we have ensured that our ancient, fertile, ideas and traditions have spread far and wide to all corners of the world throughout our storied 8000 year history.

Sadly, in modern times, our skill-set has shrunk, leaving us with only two major faculties: we are good at making civil war, and we excel at roasting nuts.

Fresh back from my trip to Lebanon, I am happy to share some of the latter with you all. Enjoy the tasty nuts in the kitchen!

Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is my privilege, once again, to provide you with a tasty sampling of the roasted nuts of my people.
Fresh from Lebanon, my mom brought a "shipment" with her ;p

Much has changed since the last bringing of nuts and there are many new pivots among you who are unfamiliar with this "tradition" so allow me to regail you with stories of their and send you back in time -- by forwarding along the original email (_see above - Ed._) that inaugurated the bringing of the roasted nuts of my people.

awesomeness
