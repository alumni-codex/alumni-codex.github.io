# Pivotal Alumni Codex

{: .text-center }
Do the Right Thing | Do What Works | Be Kind
{: .text-center }

The Codex is an index of interesting Pivotal-y resources that can help the alumni diaspora. While we have [Slack(s)](/alumni_slacks) for discussion, having a central place gets around Slack's poor and expensive search and archiving capabilities.

Surfing the navigation or searching (see above) will show you what's here today.

## Key Links

- [Alumni Slacks](/alumni_slacks) for finding former coworkers and starting discussions. Slacks exist for Pivotal and VMware almuni.
- [Agile Resources](/agile-resources) has many pages of helpful stuff you wish you'd copied out of Google Drive.
  - The [Practices](/agile-resources/practices) has links to the (now open source) [Labs Practices](https://labspractices.com/) site, as well as other templates, playbooks, etc., for various Pivotal-esque meetings and workshops.
  - There is a growing list of newsletters from pivots and others you might like.
- [Consultancies like Labs](/consultancies) is an ever growing list of the post-Labs consultancies where pivots have landed, started, or are friendly to hiring us. Perhaps you'd like to add some pivots to a team for a bit?
- Topics pages for [Product](/product/), [Design](/design/), and [Engineering](/engineering/).
- And for fun...
  - Some [Pivotal History](/history/).
  - For purchase SWAG from Bronwen's [Once a Pivot, Always a Pivot](https://www.redbubble.com/people/bronwen-a/shop) store.
