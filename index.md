# Pivotal Alumni Codex

{: .text-center }
Do the Right Thing | Do What Works | Be Kind

The Codex is an index of interesting Pivotal-y resources that can help the alumni diaspora. While we have [Slack(s)](/alumni_slacks) for discussion, having a central place gets around Slack's poor and expensive search and archiving capabilities.

Surfing the navigation or searching (see above) will show you what's here today.

This is a public site, built from text files on GitHub. It's easy to update, so if you find things you want to share, please consider [contributing](/contributing/).
