# Tools

## Window Managers for MacOS

For folks who want keyboard shortcuts to move and resize windows on their Macs.
There are dozens of these in the wild, but with the advent of Apple Silicon, many of the old tools don't work. Here are some that do:

- ShiftIt's recommendation to [use Hammerspoon and a script](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt/wiki/The-Hammerspoon-Alternative)
- Onsi's [Mosaic](https://github.com/onsi/mosaic)
- [Phoenix](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix)
- Slate
  - Originally [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate)
  - Pivotal Keystroke [config file](https://github.com/infews/workstation_repave/blob/main/dotfiles/slate)
  - Versions
    - [arm-64/Apple Silicon Slate](https://github.com/fertigt/slate_arm64)
      - `brew install --cask fertigt-slate`
    - [Intel Slate](https://github.com/mattr-/slate) - deprecated b/c of Apple Silicon
      - `brew install --cask mattr-slate`
- [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle)
  - Similar to ShiftIt. Actively maintained.
  - `brew install --cask rectangle`
